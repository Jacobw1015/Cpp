Design Ideas:
 - What kind of game do I want to make? 

# Game with Wizards (Element benders?)
   # Different Elemental Wizards - will be able to combine 2 elements at a higher level
      # Elements: Fire, Water, Earth, Air
        # Elemental Advantages:
           - Water beats Fire,
           - Fire beats Air,
           - Air beats Earth,
           - Earth beats Water
      # Sub Elements
        - Metal: Fire + Earth
        - Lightning: Fire + Air
        - Lava : Fire + Water
        - Ice: Water + Air
        - Wood/Mud : Water + Earth
        - Sand : Air + Earth 
# Level up system - Max level 50; Unlocks 2nd element at level 15;
    # When starting, player can select 1 of the 4 Elements [Fire, Water, Earth, Air];
        # Starts at level 1; Exp to next level will be 200;
        # Each level up will need 100 exp. I.E level 2 will need 300 and level 3 will need 400
    # At level 25, Wizards will pick next element 1 of the 3 remaining Elements.
      Will be able to mix Elements together to make Sub-Element Spells
